## Prerequisites

COMP142 is a required prerequisite. COMP241 is helpful, but not required.

## Course Description and Objectives

The handbook description of the course is:

> This course is an introduction to system-aware computer programming. Beginning
> with an overview of the fundamental elements and concepts that are common to
> all computer systems, including computer architecture, operating systems,
> compilers, and networks, students will learn how these affect the performance
> and behavior of computer programs. Additionally, students will learn a
> system-level programming language and set of tools for writing low-level
> programs at the operating system boundary. Students completing COMP251 will be
> prepared for advanced topics in systems, including operating system
> programming, parallel and distributed computing, and networking. Topics
> include: memory management and organization; caching and the memory hierarchy;
> system calls; network programming and I/O; processes, threads,
> synchronization, and concurrency; performance analysis and measurement; and
> debugging.

At the conclusion of this course you should be able to:

* navigate a command line environment, including using a text-based editor and
  command line interface programming and debugging toolchains.
* write programs in the C programming language.
* explain how software interacts with the operating system, and how the
  operating system interacts with hardware.
* implement concurrent programs using common threading libraries that do not have
  race conditions.
* design and implement performance-aware thread-safe libraries that expose
  flexible and robust APIs.
* design and implement communication protocols over sockets.

## Expectations

I know that COVID has recalibrated our expectations for how classes work. Even
though COVID is not "over" by any stretch of the imagination, we will attempt to
run this class as if it were pre-COVID: attendance is necessary. You are
expected to attend class and particpate in the class. I will not record
lectures, nor will I make the course available asychronously. If you have been
exposed to COVID or test positive for COVID, you __must__ follow the College
procedures for isolation. Do not come to class. Let me know __before__ you miss
class, and we can work something out.

You are expected to spend approximately 12 hours per week on this course (both
per Department of Education guidelines as well as my expectations of the work
required). This class __will__ involve a lot of work, but you will get a lot out
of it; education is transactional.

## Grading

Percent Contribution | Description
-|-
40 | Programming labs
20 | Assignments and exercises
40 | Exams (weights TBD, but the syllabus will be updated)

## Course Format

* This class is a programming-heavy course. Over the course of the semester, you
  will write several large programs or program components in a systems
  programming langauge (C). There will be 6-10 of these large assignments
  (__labs__).
* At the same time, you will have smaller, regular work assigned. These will
  include small programming exercises, writing assignments, and readings
  (__assignments__).
* We will have three exams: two __midterms__ and a __final__. The midterms will
  be scheduled at least 1.5 weeks in advance. The final will take place at the
  regularly-scheduled final exam slot. All exams are closed-book and
  closed-notes.
* Finally, you will be asked to be prepared for class by doing  readings, and to
  participate in class discussions and activities (__participation__). 

## Academic Integrity

All work turned in for this course is to be completed in accordance with Rhodes’
Honor Code. All work done for homework, programming projects, and exams is
expected to be your own. _Collaboration_ is an important component to
successfully learning the material and completing assignments in this course.
You may discuss homework problems with your classmates, but the work you turn in
must be your own.

Any submitted solutions to programming exercises not wholly written by yourself
or your group is considered plagiarism. Any and all plagiarism will be reported
to Honor Council and will result in the grade of F for the course.

## Late work

You may turn in work after the deadline for partial credit, with a penalty scale
of 10% per day.

I will not accept work more than 3 days after a deadline unless you have spoken
with me about why you need an extension.

## Diversity and Inclusion

A diverse learning community is a necessary element of a liberal arts education,
for self understanding is dependent upon the understanding of others. We are
committed to fostering a community in which diversity is valued and welcomed. To
that end any discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, gender, color,
age, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression,
genetic information, and national or ethnic origin, will not be tolerated in the
classroom.

We are committed to providing an open learning environment. Freedom
of thought, a civil exchange of ideas, and an appreciation of diverse
perspectives are fundamental characteristics of a community that is committed to
critical inquiry. To promote such an academic and social environment we expect
integrity and honesty in our relationships with each other and openness to
learning about and experiencing cultural diversity. We believe that these
qualities are crucial to fostering social and intellectual maturity and personal
growth.

Intellectual maturity also requires individual struggle with unfamiliar
ideas. We recognize that our views and convictions will be challenged, and we
expect this challenge to take place in a climate of openmindedness and mutual
respect.

## Sexual Misconduct Disclosure

I will do my best to help any student who comes to me with non-course-related
concerns. Please keep in mind, however, that all faculty are required by policy
to share knowledge of sexual assault, dating/domestic violence, sexual
exploitation, stalking, sexual harassment and sex/gender discrimination with the
Title IX Coordinator, Tiffany Cox. For more information about Rhodes’ sexual
misconduct policy or to make a report please see [www.rhodes.edu/titleix]().

_I reserve the right to alter this syllabus as necessary._
