{: .important }
Your primary resource for help in this course can always be office hours. I am
excited to be at a school like Rhodes, where I have the opportunity to work 1:1
with you. In my experience, there is no substitute for office hours!

This course has tutoring support. Your tutors will be available in the systems
lab (on the second floor, on the opposite end of the building from the CS
lounge). The room code is `1337#`.

Tutoring hours are TBA, but will be ~10 hours/week. Check back here for the
tutoring schedule.

## How to use tutoring

Tutoring is a place where you can get help with __specific questions__ from
peers who have taken 251 before. It is important that you come to tutoring with
a specific question in mind; this can be a concept that you don't understand, a
location in a project where you are stuck, etc. 

Tutors will help you work through conceptual misunderstandings by explaining
things in different ways and from the perspective of a student who was in your
situtation not long ago. They will also help you get unstuck in a project by
helping you use the tools available to you--whether these are actual tools
(i.e., `gdb`) or conceptual tools (e.g., print debugging, reading error
messages, etc.).

### Dos and Don'ts

Do:

* Expect your tutor to __ask questions.__
* Be prepared to explain __what you have tried.__
* Go __work independently__ after the tutor has given you some advice about how
  to find a bug.
* Be ready to __explore resources__ that your tutor provides to you.
* Expect your tutor to __refer you to office hours.__

Don't:

* Expect your tutor to __tell you the correct answers.__
* Go ask __how to get started.__
* __Sit with a tutor__ and code/do work.
* Expect a tutor to __write code for you__.
* __Use tutoring as a substitute for office hours__.

## Signing in

You will be expected to sign in to tutoring. I require the tutor to do this and
to keep a record of who has come to tutoring. This is for several reasons, one
of which is to determine the demand for tutoring and to justify the budget that
we spend on tutoring.

## Bias or other incidents

Tutors for 251 have gone through a bias training. If you feel as though you have
experienced bias from a tutor, please report the instance to me, either directly
or through my [feedback form](https://forms.gle/74oBX4KXSBuonmvh8).
