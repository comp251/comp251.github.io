# Welcome to COMP251!

Before we get started this semester, I'd like to get to know you a little bit,
hear about your expectations for the class, and learn about where you are in the
CS curriculum.

I'd also like for you to familiarize yourself with the course website and our
Slack workspace.

Before Friday, do the following:

* Fill out the [course survey](https://tinyr.us/251-survey) if you have not done
  so (you should've received an email from me before the semester started).
* Familiarize yourself with the course website. Browse through the resources.
  Write down three questions, feelings, or apprehensions that you have about the
  tools we'll be using (it's ok if you have no idea what anything is).
* Join the [CS Department Slack](https://rhodes-cs.slack.com) and join
  `#comp251`.

I will use the survey to generate a list of GitHub account names -- you *must*
fill out the form.
