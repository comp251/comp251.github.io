* Off campus access to Rhodes via the [Rhodes VPN](https://tinyr.us/rhodes-vpn).
  You should be given access to the Rhodes VPN, so you should not need to file a
  ticket. You will, however, need to download the Fortinet client and
  install/configure it.

* A terminal emulator or SSH client for your OS of choice. Most operating
  systems ship with `ssh` already installed.
  * OSX:
    * [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io) is a graphical SCP (and FTP, etc.)
      client.
    * You can use the built in Terminal.app, but it is a terrible program.
    * [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) replaces the super-crappy built-in terminal application.
  * Windows: 
    * [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) is a Windows SCP program.
    * You can use the build-in command prompt (modern Windows versions ship with
      `ssh`), or you can use a ssh client.
    * [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) is a commonly-used SSH client.
    * Do you have a terminal emulator or ssh client that you prefer? Let me know!
