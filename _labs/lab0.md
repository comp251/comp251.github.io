Below is the handout for Lab 0. [Accept the

The lab is due 1/30.

Before you get started, I recommend looking over the course resourses. In
particular, the resources on [ssh](/resources/ssh), [git](/resources/git), and
the [Linux command line](/resources/linux).

{: .important }
The handout assumes that you followed the
[instructions](/resources/git/#setting-up-git) for setting up git.
