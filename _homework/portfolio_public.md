# Building a Portfolio

One [objective](/homework/portfolio_intro) of this series of assignments was to
get you started in building a portfolio of code on GitHub.

A portfolio of code shows recruiters and hiring managers that you are capable of
writing code and thinking creatively to solve problems. At the very least, it
serves as evidence that the statements that you make on your resume about
languages and skills are based in truth.

You now have the start of a portfolio in the form of these katas. Before you
make your repository public, however, you will want to do some cleaning/tidying
up of the repository in order to make it easily readable and consumable by
someone browsing your GitHub portfolio.

## What should this look like?

Take some time browsing GitHub. Look at projects that you have used in the
passed, or just poke around at some random developers profiles. Take notes on
things that make repositories easy to navigate and read.

In my opinion, well-organized repositories have some common features: 

* At the very least, the repository has a __top-level README.md__ file that
  describes the repository and its organization. 
* Code is organized into a clear directory structure. Files and directory names
  are well-chosen and descriptive.
* Documentation is copious and available for sub-projects or components within
  the repository (i.e., there may be multiple READMEs).
* Build instructions are available and clear.

## TODO Checklist

Your repository is probably currently just a collection of source code files
(organized into directories). 

I would probably do the following to clean things up:

* Make sure that you merge all of your pull requests.
* Create a _top-level README.md file_ that describes the portfolio and its
  purpose.
* If you did code reviews, it's probably a good idea to make the changes that we
  discussed to make your code more professional.
* You can and should additionally go through your code and do some cleanup
  following the principles that we discussed in code review.
* Your submissions were designed to meet the assignment specifications. If you
  think that these programs should have different interfaces (e.g., receiving
  command-line arguments or being modified to be libraries rather than
  executable programs), you should make those changes.
* I would write a small README.md for each assignment. This should contain a
  description of what the program/library does _and_ how to build it.
* It might be a good experience to write a Makefile for some of these. Or one
  Makefile that builds everything. Your labs contain many examples. The link in
  the [resources pages](/resources/c) is a good intro to Make and Makefiles.
* If there is code of mine in your assignments (e.g., in the [sentiment
  analysis](/homework/portfolio05)), you must properly attribute authorship. In
  that program in particular, you should note which code is mine vs. yours.
* Eventually, you should consider creating a [GitHub
  Pages](https://pages.github.com/) page for the repo. This is very easy to do
  in the [repo
  settings](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site).
  GitHub will turn your README.md file into a page with only a small amount of
  configuration. My [homepage](https://ml8.github.io), for example, is an
  extremely simple [repository](https://github.com/ml8/ml8.github.io).

## Moving Forward

The benefit of doing programming practice is outlined in the [intro
assignment](/homework/portfolio_intro). Keep doing this work!

The intro links to other code kata pages and you can find many more by Googling.
If you want to become a better programmer, there is no better way than
practicing. If you do so, use this repo! Follow the design principles that you
establish for yourself in formatting the repository and keep building a
collection of small programs.

You should consider creating a GitHub pages (or some other web host) site for
yourself with links to projects and portfolio repositories, like this one.

I ask that you __do not__ make lab code public and would consider this a
violation of the honor code. Though you may be proud of that code, I would
prefer that you advertise it to recruiters as being "available upon request." A
former student created this
[repository](https://github.com/PepeRulo/distributed-systems) to advertise his
work for my distributed class, for example. The actual code is in separate
private repositories that recruiters can be granted access to.
